I oscillate between two major schools of thought on how best to learn. The first school of thought can be called the Consumer. The Consumer approaches a topic very simply: by consuming and organizing all materials related to that topic. For example, say the Consumer would like to learn more about the parity of zero. Is zero even, odd, or neither?  

The Consumer may start like most people, and Google "the parity of zero." They would come across the first result, a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_of_zero) entitled "Parity of zero." The information they need is the first sentence of the article:  

> Zero is an even number.  

But the Consumer does not stop there. They must read, or at least skim, the entire article. In addition, there are two important questions to ask:  

1. *Why* is zero even?
2. *Why* did I think zero was *not* even?

In other words, what is the deepest level of understanding I can get, and what caused my blind spot in the first place?  

In many cases, like this current example, there are many answers to the first question. Zero is even because:  

1. Parity alternates. $-1$ and $1$ are both odd, and zero sits right in the middle. Therefore, zero is even.
2. Zero is divisible by two (although to most people, this is not obvious).
3. A number $$n$$ is odd if there is an **integer** $$k$$ such that $$n = 2k + 1$$. If we say $$n = 0$$, then $$0 = 2k + 1$$ and $$k = -\frac{1}{2}$$. $$k$$ must be an **integer**; so we have a contradiction. Zero cannot be odd. (This might prompt further questions: if zero is *not odd*, then must it be even? Can a number be neither odd nor even?)

There are many more reasons why zero is even, depending on how you think about it. I think the best explanation is the first: all numbers, *every single one*, follows this pattern. This explanation also brings forth -- naturally -- the answer to our second question. Why did I think zero was *not* even? Because I thought zero was special. There was a simple, obvious pattern the entire time, and I missed it completely! I fell victim to the common misconception that "zero is special," just like the third graders in a [2008 paper by Ball, Lewis and Thames](http://www.jstor.org/stable/30037740) (Making Mathematics Work in School).  

As a Consumer, I read the whole Wikipedia article, including the "Education" section, which led me to a figure from that paper (cited in the wiki) with claims made by the students.  

I also saw an interesting statistic in the same section, which stated that in a survey of nearly 400 seven-year-olds, 45% thought that zero was even. What's more, in a second survey, when a third choice was added (i.e. *even*, *odd*, *don't know*), that number dropped to 32%. So, the majority of children (in other words, future adults) share this misconception.  

The consumer does not read the article in a linear fashion. The Consumer functions much like a stack.  

# The Stack

The stack is an abstract data type, a very familiar concept to many with a computer science or engineering background. The idea has an almost perfect physical analogue: a stack (of things). Any physical stack of things will do; coins, laundry, books. The point is, you must deal with the thing on top before everything under it (ideally). If you have a stack of letters, you read and reply to them one by one, from top to bottom.  

I am not a fan of analogies, especially physical, to describe data types (or anything else). In this case it works fairly well, but quickly falls short; for example, in reality you can always read your letters or books out of order. Any analogy fails to convey the benefit that comes from what appears to be a restriction. The stack is perfect for situations in which a problem is broken down into an arbitrary number of other problems, which must be completed in a strict order. In other words, the solution depends on the result of each sub-problem (which, in turn, may have other sub-problems).
