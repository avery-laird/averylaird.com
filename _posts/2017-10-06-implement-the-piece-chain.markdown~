I got a lot of awesome feedback, which I was totally unprepared for, but very encouraged by. Thanks to everyone who took the time to take a look.

This article is going to focus mainly on how I plan to implement the piece table. More specifically, a look at some of the ways I *could* implement it, and a discussion about the merits of each method.
