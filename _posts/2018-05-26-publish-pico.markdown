In my [post](http://www.averylaird.com/programming/piece-table/2018/05/10/insertions-piece-table/) last week, I mentioned having a test "toy" version. It is dubbed "pico," and is now hosted on a [public github repo](https://github.com/avery-laird/pico) for anyone to look at, tinker with, or improve. 

Pico is in the "barely works" phase, and only supports insertions for now. I will be working on this off and on over the next few weeks/months. Check it out if you'd like to contribute, or just take a look at the progress.
