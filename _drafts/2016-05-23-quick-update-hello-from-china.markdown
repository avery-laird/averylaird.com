title: Quick Update - Hello from China!
---
As most of you *probably* don't know, I've temporarily moved to China. I have been neglecting any maintenance for the past two weeks or so, and as a result some things on the site seem broken (mainly the executable cells). To be honest, I'm not totally sure: it could just be that my docker images are behind the firewall, although even using a VPN doesn't seem to fix the problem for me (which leads me to believe it's a different and more annoying problem). **At any rate,** I am looking into it, and I will fix it.

In the meantime, enjoy this pretty picture I took.

**[08:20:00 GMT] UPDATE:** I think I've fixed the problem (for now, anyway).
